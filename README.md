This is a simple weather app built using React, JavaScript, and CSS. The app allows users to enter a city name and retrieve the current weather data for that city. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.

**Features**
------------

### User can enter a city name and retrieve the current weather data

### Weather data includes temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description

### App displays the weather data in a user-friendly format

### App uses React Hooks to manage state and side effects

### App uses async/await to handle asynchronous API requests

**Installation**
----------------

### To install the app, follow these steps:

1.  **git clone https://github.com/Ak47-369/weather-app.git**
    
2.  **cd weather-app**

1.  Open the app in a web browser: **http://localhost:3000**
    
2.  Enter a city name in the input field
    
3.  Click the search button to retrieve the weather data
    
4.  View the weather data in the app
    

**API Documentation**
---------------------

### The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API, PirateWeather API, Tomorrow API, WeatherBit API to fetch weather data. The API endpoint used is:

*   **http://localhost:3000/getWeatherData**
    

### The API request is sent using the **POST** method, with the city name as a JSON payload.

**Components**
--------------

### The app consists of the following components:

*   **App.js**: The main app component renders the city input field, search button, and weather data.
    
*   **WeatherContainer.js**: A component that displays the weather data in a user-friendly format.
    

**State Management**
--------------------

### The app uses React Hooks to manage state and side effects. The state variables used are:

*   **weatherdata**: An object that stores the weather data fetched from the API.
    
*   **city**: A string that stores the city name entered by the user.
    
*   **searched**: A boolean indicating whether the user has searched for a city.
